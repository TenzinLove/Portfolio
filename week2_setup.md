# Setup

In this section, I aim to set up Visual Studio to be able to control my GitHub (Portfolio) 
via Visual Studio.
So I've made some configurations in Visual Studio to achieve this.

## Environment configuration

After installing Visual Studio and its workloads, I started configuring GitHub on VS.

Firstly, I began by connecting my github account to VS.

I then tried to clone my GitHub "Portfolio" file in VS. So, after doing Git-> Repository Clone, 
we come across the following picture where I've selected my GitHub account and the folder.

![repositoryClone](images/RepositoryClone.png)

We can now see that the Portfolio has been saved on the computer and that I can edit the texts.

![PortfolioinVS](images/Portfolio_in_VS.png)

Once this has been done, I create a commit and do Git->Push to send it to GitHub.

## Reflection

For this section, decide what points are worth making and structure your content 
appropriately.

**DO**

* Use sub-headings to differentiate between sections
* Provide <ins>reflective</ins> commentary that discusses, for example, limitations of
  your current configuration, how your configuration is appropriate for the current 
  project, alternative configuration that might be appropriate in ther circumstances, 
  etc.
* Mention any difficulties you had setting up your working environment and how you 
  resolved them

**DON'T**

* Repeat the descriptive commentary from point 1
* Give a blow-by-blow account of everything you did. Instead, you should highlight 
  the important points.
