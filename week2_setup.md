# Setup

In this section, I aim to set up Visual Studio to be able to control my GitHub (Portfolio) 
via Visual Studio.
So I've made some configurations in Visual Studio to achieve this.

## Environment configuration

After installing Visual Studio and its workloads, I started configuring GitHub on VS.

Firstly, I began by connecting my github account to VS.

I then tried to clone my GitHub "Portfolio" file in VS. So, after doing Git-> Repository Clone, 
we come across the following picture where I've selected my GitHub account and the folder.

We can now see that the Portfolio has been saved on the computer and that I can edit the texts.

Once this has been done, I create a commit and do Git->Push to send it to GitHub.

## Reflection

First of all, I think there are several reasons to use Visual Studio to manage our GitHub: 

* Easy integration: it's easy to clone GitHub files in VS, to commit changes. This means 
  we can work on a single IDE.
* We can see the changes we've made without having to modify the GitHub.

These points can only help us in our projects.

However, my setup is not ready to code in different languages.
